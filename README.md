# PawnGame

An online engine coded in Java that allows two students to play the U.S. Chess Center's Pawn Game from different computers.
This project was heavily guided by amir650's Java chess engine tutorial, particularly when it came to the GUI. Appropriate credit will be given when the project is done.
